See, i along with my friend want do a project - Housing Prices(it is a prototype name, you can later suggest better names as per requirement), in this project we have decided one objective(you can also add more after i ask you), this objective is - It will compare the Housing prices of any particular area around the world and also provide the price in multiple currencies.

so my friend will majorly work on web dev part using mern stack and i will simultaneously work on web dev + mobile app for the same

Understood.

You said:
but our main moto is to integrate an ML model with this project that can judge the prices of the housing in that area after the user selects the input region/area and also provide the desired result

so now you can start answering by your side, also tell me -
1.what more additions can we do to this project to make it better and more real world oriented
2.tell me the tech stack for both web dev and mobile app that will best integrate seamlessly with ML model as we both dont have much idea about ML model training, but the model sould be top knotch
3.we will use github for version control so also suggest idea such that we can integrate the web dev and mobile app properly as we both will work on diff laptop and from diff location but the final project shall be perfect

1. Enhancements for Real-World Use:
Historical Price Trends: Show price fluctuations over time.
Price Prediction Factors: Display key factors influencing price (e.g., crime rate, schools, amenities).
User Input Data: Allow users to add/update housing prices for real-time insights.
Visualization: Interactive maps and charts for better understanding.
APIs for Real Data: Use real estate APIs (Zillow, Realtor, etc.) for actual pricing data.
AI Chatbot: Help users get price estimates quickly via chat.

2. Tech Stack (ML Integration-Friendly):
Web Development (MERN Stack + ML Integration):
Frontend: React.js (for dynamic UI)
Backend: Express.js + Node.js
Database: MongoDB (for housing data storage)
ML Integration: FastAPI (Python) or Flask for serving ML models
API Requests: Axios for fetching ML predictions
Mobile App (React Native + ML Integration):
Framework: React Native (for cross-platform support)
State Management: Redux or Context API
Backend: Same Node.js API as the web app
ML Integration: Call ML API via REST from FastAPI
ML Model (For Price Prediction):
Model Type: Regression-based ML model (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, or Deep Learning using TensorFlow/PyTorch)
Dataset: Kaggle housing datasets or scraped real estate data
Deployment: FastAPI + Docker (for scalability)

3. GitHub Collaboration Strategy:
Monorepo vs. Separate Repos: Use a monorepo (one GitHub repo) with different directories for web, mobile, and ML.
Branching Strategy:
main → Stable production-ready code
dev → Active development
Feature branches (feature/web-ui, feature/ml-model) for independent tasks
CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
API Documentation: Use Postman or Swagger for backend endpoints
Regular Syncs: Weekly stand-up calls & code reviews via PRs
Would you like specific guidance on setting up the ML model or GitHub workflow?

noted this, but how will we keep the UI same in web and mobile app as both of us are using diff laptops and connect with each other only through Gmeet

To keep the UI consistent across the web and mobile apps, follow these strategies:

1. Common UI Design System:
Use Figma or Adobe XD for collaborative UI design.
Create reusable design components (buttons, cards, typography).
Define a color palette, font styles, and spacing guidelines.

2. Shared Component Library:
Store reusable UI components in a shared GitHub repository.
Web (React.js) and Mobile (React Native) can both use Tailwind CSS-like styles (e.g., NativeWind for React Native).
Use Storybook (for web) and React Native Storybook (for mobile) to preview UI components.

3. Code Synchronization:
Maintain a separate UI-Components folder in the monorepo.
Use GitHub pull requests to review each other’s UI changes.
Regularly test UI changes on both platforms before merging.

4. API-Driven UI Updates:
Fetch UI configurations (like theme, layout settings) from an API.
This ensures changes are reflected on both platforms dynamically.
Would you like help setting up a starter UI template for both web and mobile?
